  - gravity-bgm3
    Time + Raw counts (followed by a 2-digit error code) from the Bell BGM-3
    gravimeter. The BGM-3 has a listed bias of 855311.4 and a scale factor of
    4.9826266. 

Ex:
1331251199.965 01:024161 00
1331251200.965 01:025735 00
1331251201.975 01:026562 00


Each line has a time tag (Unix timestamp, seconds since 1/1/1970) and a string
from the gravimeter. The meter puts out an integer every second. On the top
line, the integer from the gravimeter for that second is 024161. The leading
"01" indicates that this is 1 Hz data (1 sample per second). The trailing "00"
indicates that the meter's self assessment shows no equipment failures or
errors. This is known as the "Data Not Valid" flag. The other possible states
are "01" for platform problems, "02" for sensor problems and "03" for both.
