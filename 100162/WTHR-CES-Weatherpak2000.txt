File Type: ASCII, whitespace-delimited and comma seperated values

Data Format Description:
This file contains the data produced from the Coastal Environmental Systems Weatherpak 
2000 marine weather station. Instrument contains an internal GPS but Latitude, 
Longitude, and Time is NOT to be used. Refer to specific sensor data files for that 
information, correlated with Master time in UTC from the data logging system. 
Additionally, ship's heading is not currently fed to this sensor, so do not use True 
wind or ship's heading values. This file will be updated when the sensor configuration 
changes.

File name is of format `YYYYMMDD_HHMM.[Data Type ID]`. File is created at rollover 
of the hour, or upon start of logging system or sensor.
