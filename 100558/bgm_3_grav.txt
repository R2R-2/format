  Dynamic Gravity Systems AT1 Marine Gravimeter Serial Number: 33

  Location: Aft inboard wall of tech workshop, 1-12-1
  Installation Date: 28 November 2023

  The DgS gravimeter outputs two individual data sentences. One is the raw data output from the data collection system (raw). Because there are no calibrations applied, it is not recommended to use this sentence for anything other than backup purposes. The second string (proc) is identical to the data file recorded by the DGS gravity logger software.

  Sample rate: 1 Hz

  Field Descriptions:
    LDS Logger ID
    LDS Time Stamp [UTC]
    head2: $Meter name_Meter hardware version_number of line from reset
    dgravity, dlong, dcross, dbeam: Output from the 24-bit AD converter, and filtered with a 5 sec anti-aliasing low pass filter, and a delay of 5 seconds
    Dpressure, dtemp: Unfiltered output from the 10-bit AD converter
    rvcc, rve, ral, rax: Monitors filtered with a 5 second Anti-aliasing filter and a delay of 5 seconds
    status: Integer value. All the binary codified positions are the same that in the data with the exception of the communication error that is generated by the data logger when a line doesn’t arrive within the expected time window.
    Check: is the check sum of the received data
    Latitude, longitude, speed, course: in the raw data string, the values for these will always read zero because the GPS sentence is not integrated with the raw data
    Datestamp: UTC Date and time when he meter has been synchronized or number of line after reset when the meter has not been synchronized.
