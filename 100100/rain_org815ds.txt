    Time Stamp [UTC]
    40 character long ASCII data string(*). 

  * See section 4.1.3 "C" Poll Response in included document "ORG815DS User Guide 110114.pdf".
    The "C" poll is used to obtain routine data in NWS weather code format and detailed system 
    diagnostic data. The accumulation is zero-out every 24hours at 0 UTC.

    While underway this sensor always indicates that it is raining regardless of the weather
    conditions. So usefulness of this data is probably rather limited until this issue is resolved.

 ** Sometime after sensors were mounted it appears they rotated about 45 degrees rendering the 
    concept of "across" and "forward" meaningless.
