$WIXDR Summary
NMEA 0183 Transducer Measurements.  Used in the WeatherStation to provide
wind chill data, and vessel attitude (pitch and roll) data.

Fields
<1> C = temperature
<2> Calculated “relative” wind chill temperature, degrees Celsius, to the nearest 0.1 degree
<3> C = degrees C
<4> WCHR (ID indicating relative wind chill)
<5> C = temperature
<6> Calculated “theoretical” wind chill temperature, degrees Celsius, to the nearest 0.1 degree
<7> C = degrees C
<8> WCHT (ID indicating theoretical wind chill)
<9> A = angular displacement
<10> Pitch: oscillation of vessel about its latitudinal axis.  Bow moving up is positive.  Value reported to the nearest 0.1 degree.
<11> D = degrees
<12> PTCH (ID indicating pitch of vessel)
<13> A = angular displacement
<14> Roll: oscillation of vessel about its longitudinal axis.  Roll to the starboard is positive.  Value reported to the nearest 0.1 degree.
<15> D = degrees
<16> ROLL (ID indicating roll of vessel)
